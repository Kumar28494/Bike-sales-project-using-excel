---Bike Sales Project in Excel---

Step 1: Data Import and Cleaning
1.	Import your bike sales data into Excel.
2.	Identify and clean any missing or inconsistent data.
3.	Remove duplicate values if necessary.

Step 2: Data Modeling
1.	Create a data model by going to the "Insert" tab and selecting "Table" to convert your data into an Excel Table.
2.	Name the table appropriately.
3.	Create relationships between relevant tables if your data is in multiple tables.

Step 3: Data Validation
1.	Apply data validation rules to ensure data accuracy.
2.	Use Excel's Data Validation feature to set constraints on data entry (e.g., for Age, Income, Occupation, etc.).

Step 4: Creating Charts
1.	Avg Income per Purchase:
•	Use PivotTable to calculate the average income per purchase.
•	Create a bar chart to visualize the average income.
2.	Customer Age Group:
•	Create bins for age groups using the "Histogram" feature in the Data Analysis Toolpak.
•	Generate a histogram chart to show the distribution of customer age groups.
3.	Customer Commute:
•	Use the data validation dropdown list for Commute options.
•	Create a pie chart to represent the distribution of customer commute methods.
4.	Purchase Bike & Occupation:
•	Create a PivotTable to analyze the number of bike purchases based on occupation.
•	Use a stacked bar chart to visualize the relationship between bike purchases and occupations.
5.	Bike Purchase, Region & Marital Status:
•	Use a PivotTable to analyze bike purchases based on region and marital status.
•	Create a stacked column chart to represent the relationship between bike purchases, regions, and marital status.

Step 5: Slicer for Chart Interaction
1.	Insert slicers for each chart.
2.	Connect slicers to corresponding charts to enable interactive filtering.

Step 6: Finalize and Format
1.	Format charts, add titles, and labels for clarity.
2.	Ensure that data labels and legends are appropriately displayed.
3.	Add additional insights or analysis based on the charts.

Step 7: Documentation
1.	Document the data cleaning steps, formulas used, and any assumptions made.
2.	Provide instructions on how to interact with slicers and interpret the charts.

Through this project, you will gain valuable skills and insights in several areas:
1.	Data Cleaning: You'll learn how to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data, as well as remove duplicate values to ensure the dataset's integrity.
2.	Data Modeling: By converting your data into a structured format using Excel Tables and establishing relationships between relevant tables, you'll understand the importance of organizing data for effective analysis.
3.	Data Validation: Applying data validation rules helps ensure that the entered data meets specific criteria, enhancing data accuracy and reliability.
4.	Chart Creation: You'll gain proficiency in creating various charts such as bar charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, and stacked column charts. This skill is crucial for visually representing and interpreting data trends and relationships.
5.	PivotTables: The project involves using PivotTables to summarize and analyze data, providing insights into average income per purchase and bike purchases based on different criteria.
6.	Slicer Interaction: By connecting slicers to charts, you'll understand how to create an interactive dashboard, allowing users to filter and explore data dynamically.
7.	Insight Generation: The project encourages you to draw meaningful insights from the charts, such as understanding customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and the impact of factors like occupation, region, and marital status on bike sales.
8.	Documentation: Documenting your steps, assumptions, and insights is an essential part of the project. This skill is valuable for effective communication of your analysis and findings to others.
